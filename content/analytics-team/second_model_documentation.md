## Overview
This script is designed for preprocessing MIMIC dataset files, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. It processes patient metadata, extracts features, and applies a RandomForestClassifier for classification tasks related to medical conditions.

## Model Selection
### Why Choose Random Forest Classifier?
#### 1. Robustness to Overfitting  
- Random forests consist of multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of data.  
- This ensemble approach **reduces overfitting**, making the model more generalizable to unseen medical data.

#### 2. Handling High-Dimensional Data  
- The MIMIC dataset includes diverse patient metadata and extracted features.  
- Random forests can effectively handle **high-dimensional data** without requiring extensive feature selection.

#### 3. Interpretability  
- The model provides **feature importance scores**, helping medical professionals understand which patient attributes contribute most to predictions.

#### 4. Capturing Non-Linearity and Complex Relationships  
- Medical data often contains **non-linear relationships** between features.  
- Random forests can capture these patterns better than linear models.



## Model Evaluation & Output
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Train/Test accuracy scores
   - Precision, recall, F1-score from classification reports
2. **ROC Curve Analysis**:
   - Plots ROC curves for each class label.
   - Saves the plot to the output directory.
  
### Why These Metrics?  

#### 1. Performance Metrics  
- **Accuracy**: Basic measure of correctness but insufficient for imbalanced medical data.  
- **Precision & Recall**: Essential for medical diagnosisâ€”minimizing false positives (unnecessary treatments) and false negatives (missed diagnoses).  
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall, crucial for handling class imbalances.  

#### 2. ROC Curve Analysis  
- **ROC & AUC**: Measure model's ability to distinguish between conditions.  


## Output Files
- `model2_baseline_results.json`: Contains model performance metrics.
- `ROC Curve Image`: Saved for visualizing classifier performance.
